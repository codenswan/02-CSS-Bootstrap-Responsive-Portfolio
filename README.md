# CSS-Bootstrap-Responsive-Portfolio

## This was a project designed to utilise bootstrap grids to make all pages responsive and have the same basic layout.

I used bootstrap navbar for the header section. I find it hard to get the 3 links to stay on the right-hand side of the pages when on large screen and then wrap under my name on small. I eventually used columns to get this to work, so that that on large it was pushed to the right and on small it would sit under my name.

I used cards for the portfolio and contact page. 

I could get the background image working in the CSS sheet so I just added inline styling to the HTML for the main divs on each page. 

Another tricky aspect of the pages was a sticky footer. I'm not even sure if it is technically sticky. I had to use CSS properties to manipulate the footer to get it to stay under the pages as the content extended in the smaller sized screens.

All in all, a very challenging project using bootstrap. I can see the benefit of bootstrap but it makes it very difficult when you want to do things that the bootstrap elements were not designed to do. For example, the collapsable navbar kept turning the links into a hamburger button instead of wrapping them underneath the name header. I'm not sure how I stopped that from happening. Maybe by using columns in the navbar element which I'm pretty sure was not originally intended.
